WHAT IS SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ?

A linear regression is a data plot that graphs the linear relationship between an independent
and a dependent variable(s).
It is typically used to visually show the strength of the relationship, and the dispersion of
results.

E.g. to see test the strength of the relationship between amount of ice cream eaten and
obesity.
Take the independent variable, the amount of ice cream, and relate it to the dependent
variable, obesity, to see if there was a relationship.

KEY POINTS ...

• When selecting the model for the analysis, an important consideration is model fitting.
• Adding independent variables to a linear regression model will always increase the explained variance
of the model (typically expressed as R2).
• overfitting can occur by adding too many variables to the model, which reduces model generalizability.
• A simple model is usually preferable to a more complex model.
• Statistically, if a model includes a large number of variables, some of the variables will be statistically
significant due to chance alone.
